This package constitutes an interactive R problem set based on the RTutor package (https://github.com/skranz/RTutor). 

This problem set is based on the paper "The Long-Term Effects of Communism in Eastern Europe" by Fuchs-Schündeln & Schündeln (2020). The paper can be found at https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.2.172.

The aim of the problem set is to analyze the long term effects of communism, based on several indicators and preferences of people.

## 1. Installation

RTutor and this package is hosted on Github. To install everything, run the following code in your R console.
```s
install.packages("RTutor",repos = c("https://skranz-repo.github.io/drat/",getOption("repos")))

if (!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("BenjaminMarkert/RTutorLongTermEffectsCommunism")
```

## 2. Show and work on the problem set
To start the problem set first create a working directory in which files like the data sets and your solution will be stored. Then adapt and run the following code.
```s
library(RTutorLongTermEffectsCommunism)

# Adapt your working directory to an existing folder
setwd("~/Documents/Studium WiWi BSc/Bachelorarbeit/GitHub Package/RTutorLongTermEffectsCommunism/testtt")
# Adapt your user name
run.ps(user.name="Jon Doe", package="RTutorLongTermEffectsCommunism",
       auto.save.code=TRUE, clear.user=FALSE)
```
If everything works fine, a browser window should open, in which you can start exploring the problem set.
